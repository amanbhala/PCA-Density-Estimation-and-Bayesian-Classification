# PCA-Density-Estimation-and-Bayesian-Classification
This project aims at building a digit classification project that utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Bayesian Decision Theory. The project employs a subset of images from the MNIST dataset, focusing on digits "5" and "6." The goal is to classify these two digits using dimensionality reduction and statistical modeling. The dataset consists of handwritten digits "5" and "6," with slight modifications, and is stored in .mat files. Five main tasks are performed, including data conditioning, Principal Component Analysis, Dimensionality Reduction, Density estimation, and Classification Accuracy Assessment.
