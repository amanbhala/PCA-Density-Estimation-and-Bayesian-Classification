# PCA-Density-Estimation-and-Bayesian-Classification
This project aims at building a digit classification project that utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Bayesian Decision Theory. The project employs a subset of images from the MNIST dataset, focusing on digits "5" and "6." The goal is to classify these two digits using dimensionality reduction and statistical modeling. The dataset consists of handwritten digits "5" and "6," with slight modifications, and is stored in .mat files. Five main tasks are performed, including data conditioning, Principal Component Analysis, Dimensionality Reduction, Density estimation, and Classification Accuracy Assessment.
Here, it is assumed that class 5 and class 6 both follow normal(gaussian) distribution. Using MLE , we know the mean of gaussian is the mean of the dataset and the covariance of gaussian is the covariance of the dataset. In reality, we should consider the factor of 1/(N-1)*variance, but here the ratio of N/(N-1) is 1.00008819898 which is almost 1, so we ignore it. Hence we took the covariance of the dataset itself. Based on the mean and covariance we compute the multivariate normal distribution of digit 5 class and digit 6 class. Finally accuracies for training and testing dataset have been reported.
